        <p><strong>APPLICATIONS FOR THE SYMPOSIUM ARE CLOSED</strong></p>
        <p>Consumer-facing predictive systems paint a seductive picture: espresso machines that start brewing just as you think it’s a good time for coffee; office lights that dim when it’s sunny and office workers don’t need them; just in time diaper delivery. The value proposition is of a better user experience, but how will that experience actually be delivered when the systems involved regularly behave in unpredictable, often inscrutable, ways? Past machine learning systems in predictive maintenance and finance were designed by and for specialists, while recommender systems suggested, but rarely acted autonomously. Semi-autonomous machine learning-driven predictive systems are now in consumer-facing domains from smart homes to self-driving vehicles. Such systems aim to do everything from keeping plants healthy and homes safe to “nudging” people to change their behavior. However, despite all the promise of a better user experience there’s been little formal discussion about how design of such learning, adaptive, predictive systems will actually deliver.</p>

<p>This symposium aims to bridge the worlds of user experience design, service design, HCI, HRI and AI to discuss common challenges, identify key constituencies, and compare approaches to designing such systems.</p>

  <strong>9.30-10.30: Workshop</strong><br>
  <li><strong>What’s it Good For? Envisioning New Possibilities for Machine Learning</strong><br>

This workshop is an opportunity to shift perspectives and look for new opportunities in machine learning. We’ll question current narratives and cliches, and use this as a creative opportunity to uncover new goals and approaches to the design and interactions with artificial intelligence.</li>

  <strong>10:30 am - 11:00 am   Break</strong><br>

  <strong>11:00 am - 12:30 pm   Workshop</strong><br>

<strong>12:30 pm - 2:00 pm    Lunch</strong><br>

  <strong>2:00 pm - 3:30 pm Panel discussion</strong><br>
  <li><strong>After the Handoff: Machine Learning for UX in Autonomous Drive Systems</strong><br>
    Machine learning has changed the automotive industry. As the quest to enable cars to navigate roads autonomously rockets forward, we find a newer--possibly tougher--challenge: how best to navigate the relationship with the people in and around autonomous cars? This question brings together the concerns and opportunities for machine learning and user experience in a context that everyone can understand - their drive.  This panel will host representatives from very different perspectives. Each panelist will showcase different visions of what autonomous car UX will be, grounded in their own work, highlighting different opinions of how machine learning is implicated in that experience.<br><br>
